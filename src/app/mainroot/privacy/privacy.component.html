      <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>
      <p>Your account is password protected so that unauthorized third parties do not have access to your personal information. We recommend that you do not give your password out to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to log out of your account by clicking the Logout button or close your browser window when you have finished your work. This ensures that others cannot access your account or personal information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.</p>
      <p>We use the industry standard encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS) - the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLS is composed of two layers and its record protocol provides connection security with some encryption method such as Data Encryption Standard (DES).  While we currently do not accept payment information, should we enter payment processing, we will store all password and payment information in an encrypted format.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach, by signing up for Suits + Tables, you agree to be contacted by via email, unless explicitly requested otherwise by contacting the Company.</p>

      <h3>Do we use cookies?</h3>
      <p>We do use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our website or using our services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our website; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly. Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.</p>

      <h3>Do we disclose any information to outside partners?</h3>
      <p>At this time we do not have any partners, but we retain the right to establish those relationships in the future.  As such, we currently do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.  This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.  We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.  However, to the best of our ability, we will de-identify visitor information before provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
      <p>Trusted third parties may include banks or certification authorities, used in the electronic transfer of secure data.  The third parties generally use cryptography and other security measures to authenticate the identity of the sender, the security of the data during transmission, and to verify delivery to the intended recipient.  </p>

      <h3>Third-Party Advertising</h3>
      <p>At this time we do not utilize third-party advertising.  However, we may use third-party advertising agencies or other service providers to serve ads on our website on behalf of Suits + Tables or third-party advertisers (e.g., retailers of goods or services). These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons will be based on your de-identified information. Some of these third-party advertising agencies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers you the option to opt out of ad targeting from its member agencies by following the procedures listed <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Third Parties, with whom we may partner to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, may use flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
